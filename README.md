Final Project for Winter 23/24 Javascript Class

I created a banner builder in order to be able to create a rotating text banner for websites.
The main infinite scroll banner code was created following Web Bae's youtube video: https://youtu.be/ZMCNin2VjxU?si=hgf8TFozb9PUdCxq

Next Steps for things I would like to add would be the ability to "Save" changes to localstorage and to display HTML/CSS/JS code to the user for them to be able to copy and use the banner on their website.
